## Project Description
Our project aims to create an intelligent restaurant recommendation system that helps users discover dining options based on their preferences, dietary restrictions, and past experiences. The system will analyze user reviews, ratings, and menu data to provide personalized recommendations. We will implement machine learning algorithms to understand user preferences and predict restaurant ratings. The interface will be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing users to easily input their preferences and receive tailored restaurant suggestions. The system will also include features for restaurant owners to understand customer feedback and improve their services.

## Project Outline/Plan
1. Data Collection
   - Gather restaurant data from various sources
   - Collect user reviews and ratings
   - Compile menu information and pricing
   - Build user preference database

2. Data Processing
   - Clean and preprocess collected data
   - Implement data validation
   - Create data storage structure
   - Set up data pipeline

3. Machine Learning Implementation
   - Develop recommendation algorithms
   - Train models on collected data
   - Implement rating prediction system
   - Create preference matching system

4. User Interface Development
   - Design responsive web interface
   - Create user profile system
   - Implement search and filter functionality
   - Build recommendation display system

5. Testing and Optimization
   - Conduct user testing
